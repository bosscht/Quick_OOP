# Write a program by following these requirements:
# 1. Write a function called robust_calculator
# - It should take the following parameters:
# - two numbers
# - an arithmetic operation(which can be addition, subtraction, multiplication or division and is addition by default)
# an output format(which can be integer or floating point, and is floating point by default)
# 2. The function should perform the requested operation on the two input numbers, and return a result in the requested format (if the format is integer, the result should be rounded and not just truncated)
# 3. Raise exceptions as appropriate if any of the parameters passed to the function are invalid
# 4. The program keeps running until a user enter “q” or “Q”
# Please implement at least functions get_operand() that can handle both operands and robust_calculator() that has operator and output format with default values
